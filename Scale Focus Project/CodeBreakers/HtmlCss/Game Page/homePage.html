		<div class="ATG">
        <p>The game is a simple example on the things that happend in Bletchley.</p>
        <p>So, there are two levels with two tasks on every level in the game.</p>
        <p>And you have two roles for playing. The first one is the CodeBreaker </p>
        <p>who need to guess the coordinates of the other player who is the German.</p>
        <p>So, these are the levels:</p>

        <ul>
            <div class="size">

                <b><p>Task 1:</p></b>
                <br>
                <p>The German player input 4 numbers (that are the coordinates for the ship)</p>
                <p>but he can't repeat them. And the CodeBreaker need to guess all the four</p>
                <p>of them so to break the coordinates and help to his country.</p>
                <br>
                <b><p>Task 2:</p></b>
                <br>
                <p>The German player input 4 numbers (that are the coordinates for the ship)</p>
                <p>but he can repeat them. The CodeBreaker need to guess all the four</p>

                <br>
                <p>You will be the CodeBreaker and need to guess the coordinates but this time</p>
                <p>the coordinates will be generated from the computer you will be playing against</p>
                <p>the computer. Again 4 numbers and you need to guess all of them.</p>
                <p>The numbers can't repeate.</p>
                <br>
                <b><p>Task 2:</p></b>
                <br>
                <p>You will be the CodeBreaker and you need to guess the coordinates but this time</p>
                <p>the coordinates will be generated from the computer you will be playing against</p>
                <p>the computer. Again 4 numbers and you need to guess all the four numbers.</p>
                <p>The numbers can repeate.</p>
