            <h1>The main story of the Bletchley</h1>
            <p1>
                In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break-in at his home. 
                During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.
                In 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. 
                He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. 
                Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.
                When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. 
                Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards.
                The team are trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.
